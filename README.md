# hello-world
Running through the hello-world guide
I'm a self taught "programmer", learning basic on a Texas Instrument 99/4A that I received for Christmas so long ago.  Over
the next few years I progressed through the Tandy CoCo/2 and eventually got my hands on a 286XT clone, decked out with 4 10 meg
hard drives, ega (16 color) graphics card, and a 1200 baud modem.  I even had a copy of Windows 286.  I only really wrote 2 pieces
of code of any note, a pc based back-up system for the pharmacy that I worked for on the weekends and a suite to automate Military
Police dispatchers (call logs, building locators, etc.) while a Marine at MCCDC Quantico VA.  I did come up with an idea that 
would allow you to computerize dungeons and other DnD table games making it easier for DM's, but back then I did not know what
a game engine was, so it remain unfinished.

Then I left it alone.  I got back into programming six or seven years ago as a hobby result from going back to college to finish
my degree.  I came up with an idea then, I want to see it through.  This is where it will eventually be.  

My first project is that I am going through Sherri L. Jackson's book "Statistics: Plain and simple" and creating a class library
for the entire book.  I understand that it is re-inventing the wheel, but it is a good exercise for me.  Starting in C#, I will
entend to also do a C++, Python, and (heaven help me) assembly version.  Time will tell.
